# Welcome to my first project! 

As a computer science student who loves weightlifting, I navigate two distinct yet interconnected worlds. In coding, I thrive on problem-solving and innovation, while in the gym, I seek physical strength and resilience. Both demand discipline and dedication, driving me to push boundaries and pursue progress. In this balance between mental agility and physical prowess, I find fulfillment and a holistic approach to self-improvement.

My aim with StrengthSync is to merge these two passions, with the hope of empowering individuals to navigate the realm of weightlifting with increased confidence.
